S.J. Lauro, Ph.D, (she/her) is associate professor at the University of Tampa. She is the author/editor of many academic works on slavery and resistance, including about the folkloric zombie that comes to popular attention because of the slave trade. See for example the article “A Zombie Manifesto” (*boundary2*, 2011) and the book *The Transatlantic Zombie: Slavery, Rebellion, and Living Death* (Rutgers UP, 2015). Her more recent work is on enslaved resistance in literature, art, film, and digital media. On this topic she has published articles in *TDR: The Drama Review* (2021); *History of the Present* (2020); and elsewhere. Her next scholarly monograph is devoted to commemorations of enslaved resistance; it is under contract with the University of Minnesota Press. She has begun to publish fiction, with work in *South Carolina Review* (Spring 2024) and forthcoming in *Witness*.

## Further Work on Commemoration and Opacity

*Monumental: Commemorations of Enslaved Resistance* is under contract with the University of Minnesota Press. It will address commemorations of enslaved resistance and various poetics of opacity mobilized therein in literature, art, film, digital media, museum exhibits, performance, and countermonuments.

For work on videogames that address enslaved resistance, see my two publications on archipelagos: [Digital Saint Domingue: Playing Haiti in Videogames](https://archipelagosjournal.org/issue02/playing-haiti.html) and [A Close Playing: The Videogames of Patrick Chamoiseau](https://archipelagosjournal.org/issue07/lauro-close-playing.html). 

### Kill the Overseer

[Kill the Overseer](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/kill-the-overseer) is a forerunner from the University of Minnesota Press devoted to commemorations of enslaved resistance in all kinds of videogames, from educational, to art games, to mainstream entertainment games. It explores the representation of slave revolt in video games—and the trouble with making history playable.
