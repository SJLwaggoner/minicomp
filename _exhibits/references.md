The picture above is from a shrine in Brazil devoted to the Escrava Anastácia, a folk heroine and martyred enslaved woman whose image has become an icon. You can read about Anastácia and the use of her image in commemorations of resistance in my article from Monument Lab https://monumentlab.com/bulletin/anastacia-diptych

In the video below you can hear a bit more about my research on enslaved resistance in Brazil and how it is commemorated in a videogame. This was a project that I completed as part of a Fulbright Fellowship to Salvador, Brazil in 2018; it uses an unfinished videogame, called *Thralled*, as a text. 

Keyterms include: diaspora, slavery, slave resistance, Africa, Bahia, Salvador, videogames, fugitivity, quilombo, Palmares, Zumbi

In the book I published called *Kill the Overseer* (https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/kill-the-overseer) I discuss representations of enslaved resistance in *Thralled* and in diverse other videogames. For further references to my scholarship, see ["About"]({{site.baseurl}}/about/).
