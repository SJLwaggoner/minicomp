In this video you can hear a bit more about my research on enslaved resistance in Brazi and how it is commemorated in a videogame. This was a project that I completed as part of a Fulbright Fellowship to Salvador, Brazil in 2018; it uses an unfinished videogame, called *Thralled*, as a text. 

Keyterms include: diaspora, slavery, slave resistance, Africa, Bahia, Salvador, videogames, fugitivity, quilombo, Palmares, Zumbi

In the book I published called *Kill the Overseer* [https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/kill-the-overseer] I discuss representations of enslaved resistance in Thralled and in diverse other videogames. For further references to my scholarship, see ["About"]({{site.baseurl}}/about/).
