As we drove out of Havana and towards the valley called “Matanzas,” our tour guide told us of the origin of the province’s name, meaning “massacre.” There was a legend about a Spanish execution of the Native peoples and their 1510 retaliation by throwing overboard some 30 Spaniards they had promised safe passage, as ordered by the local aboriginal chieftan Guayucayex of the province that was originally called Yucayo. (It seems like a lot of places are called “Massacre” in the Americas. There is the river Massacre on the border of the Dominican Repuclic and Haiti; there is a town called Massacre in Dominica, and there is Fort Matanzas, near St. Augustine, Florida.) In another sense, the name is fitting, as the Matanzas region was once home to various sugar plantations during the slave trade, effecting a different kind of centuries-long massacre. Today, one can visit in Matanzas the ruins of the Triunvirato sugar plantation, where a museum devoted to the rebel slave exists in a converted colonial house. 

On the grounds, a sculpture honoring a slave revolt on the plantation stands near the stone walls that outline what once were the slaves’ barracks. The monument to the rebel slave was dedicated on July 25, 1991. Three figures, larger than life, stand on a marble wall, designating (our guide told us), the three phases of the slave’s evolution in terms of abolition, from beaten down worker, to rebel slave, to freed man. The middle figure represents Carlotta, a female slave on the Triunvirato plantation who was a leader of the November 5, 1843 revolt. Bare-breasted, she wields a machete, the cane cutting tool, become weapon. Although the existent historical documents of the period come with their own set of questions, as some of the information therein was derived from testimonies given by enslaved persons after the rebellion, and may have been obtained under duress, what most accounts detail is that Carlotta died in the rebellion, which was listed as the final phase in a series of revolts called La Escalera.[^1] (For more information on this revolt, see the work of historians Ada Ferrer and Aisha Finch, for example.)[^2]

In the master’s house, a museum preserves the lifestyle of the plantation’s owners, who we were told, were rarely there, and not present during the revolt, as well as exhibits about the conditions of the slaves, the toil of working the cane, and details about the revolt and its aftermath. In the overseer’s house, a corollary museum connects the slave revolt to the Cuban intervention in Angola (launched in 1975), which was called Operation Carlotta, after the rebel. This part of the museum troubled me, as it seemed a kind of appropriation of the narrative of slave revolt for propagandistic rhetoric about Fidel’s brave leadership in the campaign. Nonetheless, the statue honoring Carlotta remains one of the most overt commemorations of a slave revolt that I have yet visited in person. In the images I’m attaching to this post, one sees the monument, including myself in one picture for the sake of scale, and some displays from the museum, including an artist’s depiction of what Carlotta, a woman of Lucumi African descent, might have looked like.
