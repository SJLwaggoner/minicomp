This website challenges readers to evaluate different commemorative gestures for the way that they offer the public a reminder of slavery and the historical reality of enslaved resistance. Some of these offer the viewer an opportunity to interact with the monument, museum display, or marker; others, resist the viewer with subvisible or inscrutable elements. Monumental is created in tandem with a book project and draws from research I have been chronicling for some years on my [Tumblr site](https://www.tumblr.com/slaveresistance). 

To learn more about the project and for info about related publications, see ["About"]({{site.baseurl}}/about/).
